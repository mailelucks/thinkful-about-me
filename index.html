  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>I am a Thinkful student expanding my front-end skills. Known for being adventurous and taking risks. Also known for being a jack of multiple trades. I canâ€™t sit still for long!</p>
  <p>I believe that <strong> new experiences</strong> are of the utmost importance for a happy life.</p>

  <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
  <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Baltimore, Maryland/Washington, D.C. I love quirky art, crabcakes with lots of old bay, and exploring urban environments.</p>
  <p>I have been doing front-end work since middle school without realizing what I was actually doing. By bouncing around between graphic design, content development and coding, my creativity is fully expressed through web work.</p>
